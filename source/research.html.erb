      <h1>Statement of Research Interests and Career Goals</h1>
      <p class="big-text text-left gradient-text">&emsp;My research focuses on the microbial trophic web, particularly on the relationships between protozooplankton and phytoplankton. To understand these relationships, I have firstly characterized the structure and variability of the heterotrophic protists community in the field, and related it to phytoplankton recurrent spring blooms. Secondly I studied the trophic links between microzooplankton and both phyto- and zooplankton. My researches highlighted the importance of dinoflagellates in terms of dominance and trophic role on phytoplankton regulation. Concurrently I assessed the taxonomic diversity of plankton via molecular tools and related it to microscopic observations. The next step was the investigation of, the functional diversity. This approach would allow understanding the succession of plankton communities linked to the environmental conditions.</p>

    <h2>1.Planktonic food web</h2>
    <p>&emsp;Since Pomeroy (1974) suggested the role of micro-heterotrophs, it became increasingly clear that protozoans play an important ecological role in the planktonic food web. This role is linked to their central position in the trophic food web as protozoans are intermediate between classic food chain and the microbial food web (Sherr & Sherr, 1986; Gifford, 1991). Microplanktonic protozoans are predators of bacteria (Fenchel, 1982; Sieburth & Davis, 1982; Azam et al., 1983), phytoplankton (Calbet & Landry, 2004), other microzooplanktonic organisms, such as protozoans and copepod nauplii, (Merrel and Stoecker, 1998; Jeong, 1999) and even aggregates (Silver et al.1984, Grossart and Simon, 1993). These micro-heterotrophs also play a role as a food source for zooplankton (copepods, rotifers, reviewed in Stoecker and Capuzzo, 1990; Gifford,1991), improving their production and survival rate (Tang et al.2001; Klein Breteler et al., 2003). Therefore, depending on the studied area, copepods can consume from 0 to 200% of the ciliates stock per day (Dolan, 1991; Nielsen & Kiørboe, 1994; Lonsdale et al.,2000; Koski et al., 2002).</p>

      <h3>1-1.Temporal variability of protist communities</h3>
      <p>&emsp;During my master’s degree and my PhD, the community structures and succession of phytoplankton, protozooplankton and mesozooplankton (copepods) s were studied from February 2007 to July 2009 in a coastal area of the eastern English Channel in which recurrent Phaeocystis globosa blooms occur. This survey allowed to identify main microplankton assemblages as well as to define interesting periods in terms of the microbial web functioning. My researches highlighted : (1) the seasonal variability of heterotrophic protists in strong relation to  the phytoplankton succession (bottom-up control); (2) the year to year variability of micrograzers in relation to P. globosa bloom magnitude and duration; and (3) the importance of dinoflagellates as major consumers of phytoplankton, particularly of diatoms and P. globosa colonies (<100 μm). This in situ survey also suggested the strong top-down control exerted by copepods on heterotrophic protists.
  The “grazing hypotheses” drawn during this first part of my PhD were then studied in two different types of experiments </p>

      <h3>1-2.Estimation of Protozooplankton herbivory via dilution experiments</h3>

      <p>&emsp;The dilution technique was used to investigate microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth in the eastern English Channel during the diatom–Phaeocystis spring succession from January to June 2009. Dilution experiments and size-fractionated dilution experiments were conducted before, during and after the P. globosa bloom and confirmed in situ hypotheses. The size classes (i.e. <5 µm; 5-10 µm and >10 µm) were chosen as they match the size spectra exhibited by the distinct life stages of P. globosa i.e. 5-10µm Chla corresponded to colonial and large flagellated cells of P. globosa whereas the <5 µm Chla essentially corresponded to small flagellated cells. Microzooplankton carbon consumption (from 18.1 to 360.9 µg C L-1 d-1) often equaled or exceeded phytoplankton production (from 1.7 to 129.0 µg C L-1 d-1) in particular at the end of the P. globosa bloom when microzooplankton grazed on previously formed phytoplankton biomass. Results of size-fractionated dilution experiments, conducted with distinct grazer communities, suggested different roles for ciliates and dinoflagellates. Ciliates appeared to be very efficient grazers of small diatoms (5-10 µm) and P. globosa free cells, whereas dinoflagellates grazed on both larger diatoms (> 10 µm P1) and small P. globosa colonies. Ciliates and dinoflagellates did not seem to compete for food resources, as they were oriented towards different phytoplankton size classes.</p>

    <h3>1-3.Zooplankton grazing impact on protozooplankton via a microcosm experiments </h3>

    <p>&emsp;The importance of heterotrophy in the eastern English Channel was estimated in dark microcosms experiment during 19 days. By excluding physical forcing and nutrient input, this microcosm study confirmed the role of protozooplankton as major consumers of phytoplankton during the Phaeocystis globosa bloom, especially before the establishment of zooplankton metazoans. Three periods were defined during the microcosm experiment based on phytoplankton and microzooplankton dynamics: Period Pphyto corresponding to phytoplankton growth; Period Pmicroz characterized by the dominance of protozooplankton and Period Pmetaz dominated by metazoans such as rotifers and copepods. During Pphyto and Pmicroz, the major part of phytoplankton was consumed by protozooplankton. Micro-heterotrophs grazing pressures (% biomass consumed per day) reached 10-25% d-1 for nanophytoplankton and 15-20% d-1 for < 100µm diatoms. Rotifers and copepods were identified as major phytoplankton and protozooplankton consumers during Pmetaz. Comparison with the in situ survey showed that metazoan’s predation could be the main control of protozooplankton during the wane of the P. globosa bloom. Metazoans peaked one week delay after protists, suggesting time lag response to available trophic resource for these two groups. This experiment allowed estimating the metazoan impact (particularly rotifers) on microplanktonic protozoans (predation/competition).</p>

      <h2>2.Diversity of plankton component</h2>

      <p>&emsp;The studies carried out in the eastern English Channel suggested the importance of species-specific relationship between phytoplankton and protozooplankton. From these considerations, I undertook study of plankton diversity of the eastern English Channel during my PhD. During the in situ survey, some protoplankton organism was easily identified like characteristic Myrionecta rubra, Laboea strobila, Spatulodinium pseudonoctiluca. However I noticed that it was sometimes difficult to morphologically differentiate protoplankton organisms from observation by microscopy.</p>
      <p>Clone library construction appeared to be an efficient tool to assess plankton diversity missed by microscopic observation. For this reason, I undertook a part of my PhD abroad at the Kormas’ laboratory (Thessaly University, Greece) to diversify my research on protists and particularly to develop new skills in molecular biology (extraction, PCR, DGGE, cloning). However, the sequences obtained were in few number (15 sequences/70 clones) due to technical problems and most of them corresponded to uncultured eukaryotes.</p>
      <p>The other method used is high-throughput sequencing. This emerging method allowed estimation the diversity of the whole community. The objective was to compare morphological diversity from microscopic observations to taxonomic diversity from pyrosequencing analyses. This comparison allowed determination of various protozooplanktonic species grouped generally in morphotypes (e.g. Gyrodinium, Strombidium) and highlighted the rare biosphere (Fungi, Phaeocystales,…).</p>
      <p>In the Katz lab, I work on diversity with DGGE and next-Gen sequencing in collaborations with the Pr. George B. McManus (University of Connecticut Department of Marine Sciences) on the biogeography of choreotrich and oligotrich ciliates.</p>

      <h2>3.Metagenomic approach</h2>

      <p>&emsp;The next step would be to study the seasonal variation in taxonomic diversity of plankton communities for a better identification of species-specific relationship between phyto- and protozooplankton. In the same idea, the study of functional diversity would allow a better understanding of plankton structure variations in relation to the environmental changes. The metagenomic approach will be used to investigate the entire genetic content of plankton community and will therefore unveil the ecological functions present in the ecosystem. The method goal is notably to observe the metabolism of uncultured planktonic community representing 99% of all plankton organisms (Xu, 2006). In addition, the cultured organism metabolism could differ from natural organism subject to culture stress (Xu, 2011). This method would provide a good picture of the ecosystem health, and would allow identification of new genes with ecological and biotechnological importance (e.g. toxins production).</p>

      <h2>4.Career Goals</h2>

      <p>&emsp;My career goals are to expand my knowledge on heterotrophic protist diversity and its impact on the trophic food web in various areas. In addition, as a young researcher I wish to broaden my research perspectives and opportunities without limiting myself to geographical considerations.</p>
